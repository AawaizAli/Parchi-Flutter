// Simple Get context helper mock since looking at previous files didn't show GetX usage but context is needed for Theme.
// Wait, previous files show standard Riverpod/Flutter. I should use standard context passed to build or just Theme.of(context) if inside a widget.
// The ExpansionTile needs a context for Theme.of(context).
// I will adjust `_buildFaqItem` to take `BuildContext context` or remove the Theme wrapper if not strictly necessary,
// but the customized Theme wrapper is good for hiding dividers.
// Let's rewrite `_buildFaqItem` to use `Builder` or just standard styling.
// Actually standard ExpansionTile has `shape` and `collapsedShape` properties in newer Flutter versions to hide borders.
// But to be safe and compatible, wrapping in Theme with transparent divider color is a classic trick.
// Since `Get.context` is not guaranteed, I'll remove it.
// I'll rewrite the helper in the actual file writing call.
